-fn(acc + x) is the same as &(&2 + &1)

- adding two backwards slashes to an argument is how you set a default to an argument -> Example: def add (acc \\ 1, n), do: <-- this sets the accumulator default set to 1 if there is no argument.
Another example: def state(counter \\ :counter) do <--- this just means if there is no argument when you call the state, it will default to :counter)

- def start in our service.ex is our lifecycle management function
- start > run > listen > run > listen > run > listen <--- this whole session is continuous due to the run function
- inside of IEX:
counter = start(42)
inc(counter) -> returns :inc
state(counter) -> return the number (42)

- Homework - find something to memorize:
"what runs but never walks, and has a mouth but never talks"

what does the flashcard look like
what is your strat for computing the CRC
-
prepare the work
do the work
present the work

#flash_card
-text

#number of steps
-5

#accumulator
- ""

#list of words
- ~w[
#reducer
- fn word, acc -> word <> " " <> acc


Enum.reduce(numbers, reduce)
0 |> reduce.(12) |> reduce.(13) |> reduce.(14)

both return 39

0 is the accumulator (the starting point)
accumulator is the starting point of whatever you're doing (a list of numbers or a string)

c - t's an intermediate value that keeps transformation
t - our current state is an accumulator
z - he starting state of your function
b - cratch pad of taking notes of intermediate values, one small step at a time, acc is the value so far, number would be total, string would be what it is so far

list = [12, 15, 40]
reducer = fn number, acc -> number + acc end
enum.reduce(reduce, list, reducer)

Elixir will always pick an accumulator from your list.


init = Retain.new
handle_cast = the reducer
handle_call = the txt

-Maps on the boundary
-Structs on the core

:observer.start()  <--- inside of iex -S mix , this will open up a window for viewing the supervisor and children currently running

is there a way to have the genserver restart and keep almost all the lost data instead of just reverting to the last save point?
"hydration, inside your application you can set your own rules for the application or children" - bruce

You can have more than 1 application file to spider web out for setting up dependencies and then using rest_for_one strategy for the supervisor restart.

Inside of the mix.exs is where we put the additional applications.


spawn_link fn -> raise "boom" end
(this will supervise the iex and restart)
